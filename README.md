# SurgeVirtualPythonAssistant

This was my 11th grade year end python project in 2019

It was a team project but I did all of the coding and my teammates did the writeup. They also suggested to add certain functions like calendar and games.
My teammates were'nt so good at coding and I really hated doing writeups so I found the work split equal back then.

Reflecting back on the code, I realise it can be improved because it has a lot of if-else statements and the code is all in one file

I also see a lot of other inefficiencies now like the inside of the if else statements that checks for a word can be converted to a function and a lot of the graphics can be done on tkinter

And the fact that in the writeup we called it an AI is hilarious.
This was 3 years before chatgpt and AI was more of a concept in our heads from iron man than an actual intelligence

But overall for a project where I learnt python and coding for a year and could only use the default python modules
I think I did a pretty good job
Im happy with it

The code is in THE MAIN CODE IS HERE.py (there were multiple "main codes" hence the name)
The rest of the functions I built up induvidually for testing and then put them together
We had ideas to put functions like snake and chess that I got from online but they were'nt put inside as they used external modules.

I used an ASCII website to generate the graphics for the coin flip and magic 8 ball
